## Component 7
This assignment explored using Python and sklearn within a JupyterLab environment. Logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks were explored using a car dataset.

[Here](https://github.com/JHoGit1/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Component%207/C7_ML_with_sklearn.pdf) is the Jupyter notebook for carrying out different statistical analysis with sklearn.

## Component 8
This assignment utilized Python and Keras to carry out image classification. A couple of different models were utilized to train the model and test it against a test dataset. The model was trained to recognize all the playing cards that were of the suit spades, and to attempt predicting the playing card.

[Here](https://github.com/JHoGit1/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Component%208/C8_Keras_Image_Classification.pdf) is the Jupyter notebook that contains the few models used to try and conduct image classification.
