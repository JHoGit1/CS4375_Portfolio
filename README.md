# F22_CS4375_Portfolio
A portfolio for the CS4375 ML class. This will be updated for the class.

## Assignment 1
Click [here](Jonathan_Ho_Overview_of_ML.pdf) to view the pdf document related to this assignment.

## Assignment 2
This assignment is to code the R statistic functionalities in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_stat_functs.cpp) is the C++ code for the statistical functions.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_Component_1_Report.pdf) is the short write up after coding the said functions.

## Assignment 3
This assignment is using the statistical functions built into R to carry out Linear and Logistical Regression

[Here](Regression.pdf) is the linear regression on a dataset.

[Here](Classification.pdf) is the logistical regression on a dataset.

## Assignment 4
This assignment is coding Logistical Regression and Naive Bayes using C++. An overview document is written as well.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_LogReg.cpp) is the Logistical Regression code in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_NaiveBayes.cpp) is the Naive Bayes code in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_Overview_Component 4.pdf) is the overview document with the outputs and discussions of reproducable ML reserch.
