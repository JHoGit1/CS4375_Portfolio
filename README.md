# F22_CS4375_Portfolio
A portfolio for the CS4375 ML class. This will be updated for the class.

## Assignment 1
Click [here](Jonathan_Ho_Overview_of_ML.pdf) to view the pdf document related to this assignment.

## Assignment 2
This assignment is to code the R statistic functionalities in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_stat_functs.cpp) is the C++ code for the statistical functions.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_Component_1_Report.pdf) is the short write up after coding the said functions.

## Assignment 3
This assignment is using the statistical functions built into R to carry out Linear and Logistical Regression

[Here](Regression.pdf) is the linear regression on a dataset.

[Here](Classification.pdf) is the logistical regression on a dataset.

## Assignment 4
This assignment is coding Logistical Regression and Naive Bayes using C++. An overview document is written as well.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_LogReg.cpp) is the Logistical Regression code in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_NaiveBayes.cpp) is the Naive Bayes code in C++.

[Here](Jonathan_Ho_Overview_Component_4.pdf) is the overview document with the outputs and discussions of reproducable ML reserch.

## Assignment 5
This assigment explores similarity models, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques. Discussion of the algorithms and techniques are also explored. The assignment was done in a group with Khang Thai, David Park, and David Favela.

[Here](C5_Linear_Regression.pdf) is the notebook for linear regression.

[Here](C5_Logistic_Regression.pdf) is the notebook for logistic regression.

[Here](C5_Clustering.pdf) is the notebook for clustering.

[Here](C5_Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf) is the notebook for dimensionality reduction.

[Here](C5_Narrative.pdf) is the discussion on the differen algorithms and techniques.

## Assignment 6
This assignment explored the different Kernel and Ensemble methods. Discussion of SVM and Ensemble methods were done as well.

[Here](C6_Regression_SVM.pdf) is the R notebook for Regression SVM

[Here](C6_Classification_SVM.pdf) is the R notebook for Classification SVM.

[Here](C6_Ensemble.pdf) is the R notebook for Ensemble methods on the Classification SVM data.

[Here](C6_Jonathan_Ho_SVM_ES.pdf) is the narrative and discussions exploring SVM and Ensemble methods.

# Assignment 7
This assignment explored using Python and sklearn within a JupyterLab environment. Logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks were explored using a car dataset.

[Here](C7_ML_with_sklearn.pdf) is the Jupyter notebook for carrying out different statistical analysis with sklearn.

# Assignment 8
This assignment utilized Python and Keras to carry out image classification. A couple of different models were utilized to train the model and test it against a test dataset. The model was trained to recognize all the playing cards that were of the suit spades, and to attempt predicting the playing card.

[Here](C8_Keras_Image_Classification.pdf) is the Jupyter notebook that contains the few models used to try and conduct image classification.
