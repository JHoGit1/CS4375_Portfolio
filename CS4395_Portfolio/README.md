## Component 1
This assignment is utilizing Python to create a simple script that can take in and process data from a .csv file.

## Component 2
For this assignment, a Python script was created to be able to preprocess and tokenize a text file, find the 50 most common used nouns, and pick one word from the common nouns to use for a guessing game.

## Component 3
For this assignment, the WordNet package from NLTK is explored using Google Colab.

## Component 4
Exploration of Ngrams were conducted by utilizing Python code. The code is split into two programs. The first program took in texts to create unigram and bigram dictionaries and pickled them. Then, the second program would unpickle the dictionaries to interpret a test file with lines of languages varying between English, French, and Italian. The language model would determine the probabilities of each language for each line and output to a text file what language it thinks that test line is. An overview narrative was then written.
